# Animated Code Input

## Description

Animated code input component for React Native, with support for iOS, Android, and React Native Web. It works with one-time password autofill on iOS and Android.

This component is fully customizable. You can change the appearance of the fields, cursor and animation timing. It presents code in separate input fields without losing support for filling out one time passwords from messages.

Two-factor authentication, for a good reason, is part of more and more applications. Many times the screen where the user has to enter the code is one of the first screens they will see in your app. As you know, users are fast to judge your app quality by the UI. Why not give them a sweet looking eye candy, where your app can stand out from the others? That's why we are sharing with you our Animated Code Input Field.

**Support: RN >=0.59.0**

## Demo

A small demo showing the animations and an automatic fill in of one-time passwords. On Android the user must tap the Copy button in the notification popup.

| `onSubmitCode` (**Required**)  | function     |               | Callback function called when every input field has a value. You will receive code value passed in as parameter                                                                                    |
