# react-native-svg-chicken
Animated chicken using Animated and react-native-svg Library, built for React Native framework.
It was a perfect practice to master the concept of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in react native.
Each component was rendered with absolute position in specific order to overlap each other. Check the scale.js file to scale the chicken to a different size.
