    'Here are a few quick points about this app: \n\n\u2022 Just because tipping is accepted does not mean that it is expected. Some tips in this app are labelled "Tipping Optional". It may be enough to just say "keep the change". \n\n\u2022 This app calculates the minimum expected amounts. Rounding up is advised for great service. \n\n\u2022 Services which cater exclusively to tourists may be accepting of tips even in countries which do not usually practice tipping. eg: tour guides. \n\n\u2022 In most countries tipping is uncommon in rural areas. \n\n\u2022 The restaurant tips in this app should not be applied to fast food shops. \n\nThe information in this app is accurate to the best of my knowledge and is intended to be used as a quick reference. It is advised that you do further research. I\'m always looking to improve this information so contact me via the \'More\' tab with any changes I should make.',
