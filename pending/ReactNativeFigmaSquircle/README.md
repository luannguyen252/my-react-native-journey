> Figma-flavored squircles for React Native

## Disclaimer

> This library is not an official product from the Figma team and does not guarantee to produce the same results as you would get in Figma.

## What is this?

Figma has a great feature called [corner smoothing](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050986854-Adjust-corner-radius-and-smoothing), allowing you to create rounded shapes with a seamless continuous curve (squircles).

This library helps you bring those squircles to your React Native apps.

## Installation

Install [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg)

Then install this library:

```sh
yarn add react-native-figma-squircle
```

or

```sh
npm install react-native-figma-squircle
```

## Usage

A `SquircleView` can be used just like a normal `View`, except the background is rendered separately from the view background. So to change how it looks, you'll have to use the `squircleParams` prop instead of the `style` prop.

```jsx
import { SquircleView } from 'react-native-figma-squircle'

function PinkSquircle() {
  return (
    <SquircleView
      style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
      squircleParams={{
        cornerSmoothing: 0.7,
        cornerRadius: 30,
        fillColor: 'pink',
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

You can also use it with [MaskedView](https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view) to apply the squircle shape to an `Image`.

```jsx
import MaskedView from '@react-native-community/masked-view'

function ProfilePicture() {
  return (
    <MaskedView
      style={styles.profilePicture}
      maskElement={
        <SquircleView
          style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}
          squircleParams={{
            cornerRadius: 30,
            cornerSmoothing: 0.7,
            fillColor: 'pink',
          }}
        />
      }
    >
      <Image style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill} source={{ uri: 'https://...' }} />
    </MaskedView>
  )
}
```

## Props

Inherits [View Props](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view#props)

### squircleProps

An object that controls how the squircle looks.

```ts
interface SquircleProps {
  cornerRadius: number
  cornerSmoothing: number
  fillColor?: Color
  strokeColor?: Color
  strokeWidth?: number
}
```

#### cornerSmoothing

> `number`

Goes from 0 to 1, controls how smooth the corners should be.

#### cornerRadius

> `number`

Similar to `borderRadius` in the `style` prop.

#### fillColor

> `Color` | defaults to `#000`

Similar to `backgroundColor` in the `style` prop.

#### strokeColor

> `Color` | defaults to `#000`

Similar to `backgroundColor` in the `style` prop.

#### strokeWidth

> `number` | defaults to `0`

Similar to `borderWidth` in the `style` prop.
