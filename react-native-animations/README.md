# React Native Animations

> Learn about how to create a great user experience using Animation libraries with React Native.

Animations should be used to improve the user experience of your application. They shouldn't be used just to delight the user as these tend to end up being pointless and actually hinder your users.

Animations can be used to reduce cognitive load, define relationships between elements, provide visual hints, and much more.

Overall animations are generally added later but provide immense value to your users and I will teach you how to breakdown animations, understand them, rebuild them, and implement them in your own applications.
