# React Native - Flexbox

## Layout

To achieve the desired layout, flexbox offers three main properties

1. `flexDirection`

`flexDirection: "column"`
`flexDirection: "row"`

Used to specify if elements will be aligned vertically or horizontally.

2. `justifyContent`

`justifyContent: center`
`justifyContent: flex-start`
`justifyContent: flex-end`
`justifyContent: space-around`
`justifyContent: space-between`

Used to determine how should elements be distributed inside the container.

3. `alignItems`

`alignItems: center`
`alignItems: flex-start`
`alignItems: flex-end`
`alignItems: stretched`

Used to determine how should elements be distributed inside the container along the secondary axis (opposite of flexDirection)
