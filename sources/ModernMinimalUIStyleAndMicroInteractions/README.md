# Modern Minimal UI Style

> Functional, readable, sleek, and sexy. "The interfaces should be minimalistic, which makes them more usable."

## Bright backgrounds and whitespace

[Bright backgrounds and whitespace](./documents/1-bright-backgrounds-and-whitespace.png "Bright backgrounds and whitespace")

In modern minimal, the whitespace is king. The whole content of the interface is most often presented on a white or a very bright background. The thoughtful use of whitespace makes the interface look clean, fresh and aesthetically pleasing in general.

## Subtle roundness on UI elements

[Subtle roundness on UI elements](./documents/2-subtle-roundness-on-ui-elements.png "Subtle roundness on UI elements")

The UI elements in Modern Minimal style are subtly rounded. It makes the interface look more organic and friendly.

If you know the latest craze called Clubhouse, you're probably familiar with their rounded avatars. They make the whole product look more original and distinctive!

Personally, I'm a big fan of rounded corners (they are more pleasurable for our eyes contrary to the sharp ones). The trick is to not overuse the roundness, but rather save it for certain elements, like buttons and containers. The radius of the corners shouldn't exceed certain values (better slightly than fully rounded — this rule doesn't apply to the full rounded buttons though).

## Big, readable headings

[Big, readable headings](./documents/3-big-readable-headings.png "Big, readable headings")

I love those big, fat headings! They are also making the interface look more modern. You can choose between sans-serif or serif, but personally, I'd recommend sticking to the popular geometric sans-serifs like [Gilroy](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/radomir-tinkov/gilroy), [Sofia Pro](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro), Lufga, or [Circular](https://lineto.com/typefaces/circular). You can also try [Pulp](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/the-fabriek/pulp-display/), [Gordita](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-atelier/gordita/), [Visby](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/connary-fagen/visby-cf/), [Konnect](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adam-ladd/konnect/), [Geliat](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wahyu-sani-co/geliat-/), [Galano](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/galano-grotesque/) or [+Jakarta Sans](https://opensourcelibs.com/lib/plusjakartasans).

## Real-life photography

[Real-life photography](./documents/4-real-life-photography.png "Real-life photography")

Yes! Modern Minimal embraces real-life photography.

I've predicted the comeback of the real-life photos in my article about [2021 Design Trends](https://uxdesign.cc/a-guide-of-ui-design-trends-for-2021-637ac038cb99). It was inevitable — everybody is slowly getting sick of all the childish 3D renders, flat people, and hand-drawn scribbles. Real-life photos have one big advantage — they simply look "real" and they bring a touch of reality to digital products.

My own research studies on the projects I've been working on also clearly show, that users prefer photos to illustrations, cause they look more serious and they relate to real-life experiences on an emotional level.

## Thoughtful use of colors

[Thoughtful use of colors](./documents/5-thoughtful-use-of-colors.png "Thoughtful use of colors")

Modern Minimal style is often very minimal when it comes to colors. They are mostly reserved for the most important actions and/or accents on elements.

Thanks to that, the interface is pleasurable to look at, since no big splashes of colors scream for attention of the user all the time.

## Focus on contrast

[Focus on contrast](./documents/6-focus-on-contrast.png "Focus on contrast")

One great thing about Modern Minimal is its accessibility (that one thing that most styles suck at apparently). With enough contrast we can easily differentiate background from the elements, understand the visual hierarchy and use the interface with ease.

## Limited use of effects

[Limited use of effects](./documents/7-limited-use-of-effects.png "Limited use of effects")

Modern Minimal draws inspiration from many different styles and effects. Subtle colorful shadows, blurred aurora backgrounds, embosses and even glassmorphic elements are welcome — to some healthy extent. Thanks to that, the interface can remain readable and visually uncluttered.

## Small details, often illustrated

[Small details, often illustrated](./documents/8-small-details-often-illustrated.png "Small details, often illustrated")

What I also really like about Modern Minimal is the attention to details. Despite it's minimalistic form, it accepts small friendly elements — icons, emojis and other graphic elements such as patterns and collages, that mix up real-life photos with illustrations. The use of the graphical elements that we're all used to using on a daily basis, makes the interface more welcoming and fun.

# UI Micro-Interactions

> Without microinteractions, the sophisticated user experience of apps seems to be impossible now.

> According to this, microinteractions are the kind of interactions that we seldom notice separately while they play a crucial role in making the user experience better.

[Dan Saffer's model of microinteractions](./documents/dan-saffers-model-microinteractions.png "Dan Saffer's model of microinteractions")

[Aaron Walter's pyramid of user needs](./documents/aaron-walters-pyramid-user-needs.jpg "Aaron Walter's pyramid of user needs")

There are four parts of microinteractions, such as the below mentioned.

1. **Triggers:** Triggers initiate the microinteractions. The Triggers for microinteractions can be either initiated by the system or the user. While in the case of the first, the software app kicks off an action based on certain interactions and parameters. In the case of the second, the user takes action leading to interaction with the software app.
2. **Rules:** There must be rules to determine the triggering of microinteractions based on preconceived criteria and parameters.
3. **Feedback:** When a micro-interaction takes place, it is the responsibility of the system to let the user know what's happening through specific feedback.
4. **Loops and Modes:** Loops and modes determine the after-effects and deviation of the preconceived interactions. For example, when using the "refresh" button, a page is reloaded. If it fails to load, the user can see a message about network error or slow connection or alternate solutions.

> Well, in spite of the fact that such small interactive design elements may not be visible all the time but they can play a significant role in engaging the users and helping them get things done more quickly.

Let us quickly see the key benefits if microinteractions design from the UX perspective.

- Microinteractions help to optimize the website navigation to a great extent.
- They help easier interactions with the users.
- By providing prompt feedback about any completed action, microinteractions enhance user satisfaction.
- They always allow users to enhance user experience with helpful tips and on-screen suggestions.
- Microinteractions, without drawing much attention, subtly improve user experience. In that sense, they cause the least cognitive lead on the web or app design.
- Thanks to microinteractions, users can share, comment, and like content and engage with the app or web content more effectively.
- Microinteractions always help to create an emotional bond with the users.

### Key Things to Do and Avoid When Designing Microinteractions

> Yes, such subtle and almost non-visible elements in and around the on-screen content actually help the engaging audience.

Microinteractions, without catching too much attention of the audience, subtly interact with the audience and help to engage the users in a frictionless manner. When designing microinteractions, follow the below-mentioned principles and tips for the most effective output.

- Always create microinteractions that are functionally superb while remaining almost `invisible or inconspicuous`.
- Always ensure that the micro-animations do not hamper the frictionless user interactions by preventing users from getting what they need the app for.
- Design microinteractions with the long term design objective in mind. Always make sure they don't cause stress on the users because of repeated use.
- Always maintain simplicity when designing microinteractions. Make sure the microinteractions doesn’t take longer to load and undermine the otherwise fast-paced user experience.
- When designing microinteractions always make sure they fit perfectly into the design elements.
- When there is a certain level of complexity in the micro-interaction design, always evaluate how legitimate is it and how and when it can help your users.
- Always make sure the microinteractions remain as essential design elements for the user interface, and instead of creating a design, boredom actually becomes key UX elements for your digital brand. Consider how Facebook "Like" became synonymous with the platform.

## How do we use UI microinteraction to improve UX?

The pyramid of user needs makes it evident that good user experience is more than good usability. Enjoyable user experience makes the interaction with product fun, and this ultimately drives user engagement. But what is the role of microinteractions in creating pleasure? Those micro elements play a huge role. They can:

- Encourage user engagement. Microinteractions can enhance the sense of direct manipulation.
- Help users prevent errors. Microinteractions can help users see the results of their actions.
- Communicate brand and brand values. Well-designed microinteractions are a clear sign of a care of a user.

## When do we need UI microinteraction?

Many of our everyday interactions with digital devices fall under the large umbrella of microinteractions. Here are the most common cases:

- Confirm user action. Visual feedback that the user sees when they tap on the button or any other interactive element acts as an acknowledgment. The user knows that the system received his command and is working on it.
- Convey system status. According to Jakob Nielsen, the visibility of system status is [usability heuristic](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/) of the user interface. UI microinteractions make it easier for users to understand what the system is doing at any moment. A typical example is a progress bar that the system shows as a response to the user action. The progress bar makes it easier for users to predict how much time the operation will take.
- Better error states. Well-designed UI microinteractions help to communicate the problem to users and, in some cases, guide users to solutions.

## How to design micro-interactions?

Making micro-interactions is exciting for designers, because it is possible to experiment new design solutions and look for new ways to surprise the users. But for doing it you must keep in mind a few things:

- **Put yourself in the users shoes** and use all that you have to figure out how they use your app.
- **Create functional animations.** Animations which have not only an aesthetic but which are able to enhance the user experience.
- **Have fun and entertain your users.** What the user feels when he uses the app is the reason behind the fact that he keeps using it. If the user enjoys the experience and finds it pleasant, he returns.
- **Do not be annoying.** Too many animations have the opposite effect on users. Annoying users make them stay away from your app.
- **Use a human language** and non-technical. A funny and ironic copy can make you forget for a moment how frustrating it might be a blank page within the app.

## What are Micro-Interactions?

Micro-Interactions are like any other interactions with devices, which are used to communicate meaningful feedback to the users because a user has to constantly know what happens when an action is performed. It's a human tendency to expect something to happen when you click a button, scroll a page, add an item to the cart, left swipe a card.
