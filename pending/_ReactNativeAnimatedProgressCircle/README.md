# React Native Animated Progress Circle

Currently working on both Android and iOS on version 0.57 of react-native and up [with the addition of support for overflow style property on Android](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#android-specific-additions-3)

| value                   | Number / Animated.Value | Number between `0-1` which indicates the total progress of the circle. Default value is `0`. Also accepts an `Animated.Value` (to be interpolated 0-1) if you wish to handle the timing of the animation outside of the component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| color                   | String                  | Sets the color of the complete portion of the progress circle. Default color is `#7e42ed`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| unfilledColor           | String                  | Sets the color of the incomplete portion of the progress circle. Default unfilledColor is `transparent`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| animationMethod         | String                  | Animation method to be used. Takes one of the following strings: `timing`, `spring`, `bounce`, `decay`. Setting this value will animate the component. Please note that this prop will have no effect if you choose to pass in an `Animated.Value` instead of a `Number` to the `value` prop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| animationConfig         | Object                  | Configuration object to set animation parameters. See configuration docs for [timing](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated#timing), [spring](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated#spring), [bounce](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated#bounce), and [decay](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated#decay). `useNativeDriver` is set to `true` by default. Please note that this prop will have no effect if you choose to pass in an `Animated.Value` instead of a `Number` to the `value` prop. |
| shouldAnimateFirstValue | Boolean                 | Indicates whether the initial value passed to the `value` prop should animate in or not. Defaults to `false`. If set to true, you should specify how you want the progress circle to animate via `animationMethod` and `animationConfig` props. Please note that this prop will have no effect if you choose to pass in an `Animated.Value` instead of a `Number` to the `value` prop.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| onChange                | Function                | Callback function which gets called when the `value` prop changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| onChangeAnimationEnd    | Function                | Callback function which gets called when the animation that occurs after the `value` prop changes is complete. Please note that this prop will have no effect if you choose to pass in an `Animated.Value` instead of a `Number` to the `value` prop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
