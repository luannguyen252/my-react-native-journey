# The React Native Animated Sprite Matrix

Animated Sprite Matrix provides a simple component for use with the 
[react-native-animated-sprite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-animated-sprite) component. This allows you to use a [sprite](https://github.com/micahrye/rn-animated-sprite-matrix/tree/master/example/app/matrix/sprites/monster) to create N x M matrices of animated-sprites.  

Animated Sprite Matrix is ideal for use in general applications or games. Development has been driven by [Curious Learning's](http://www.curiouslearning.org/) work in cognitive assessment and literacy.
